      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
My name is Surya Mishra. I was born into a life shaped by displacement, injustice, and years of uncertainty. I grew up as a refugee, learning resilience not from textbooks but from hunger, struggle, and the quiet strength that comes from surviving what should have broken you.
In time, my journey carried me across the world to the United States, where I rebuilt myself piece by piece. I am a product of second chances, a life once uprooted, now replanted with purpose and hope. I carry my past with pride, not as a burden but as a reminder of how far I've come.
This is just the beginning of my story. More to come.
